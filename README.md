# BetterThePicture
## Enhance your photography skills through reflective journaling.

**BetterThePicture** is a Java desktop application that helps users document and reflect on their photography. Users can record photo entries along with technical details like camera model, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. They can also write down thoughts and improvements, and mark any areas in the photo they feel could be improved (e.g., lighting, composition). Over time, this creates a personalized learning gallery that can be revisited to better understand how to take great photos in similar situations.

This application is especially helpful for beginner photographers who are still exploring how to use manual settings on their cameras. As someone who enjoys photography but sometimes struggles with technical configurations, I wanted to build a tool to help myself and others review past mistakes and improve faster.
